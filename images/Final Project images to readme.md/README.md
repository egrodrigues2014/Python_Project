# FINAL PROJECT: INVESTMENT SIMULATOR
## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description 

This was my final project for conclude the CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python.

INVESTMENT SIMULATOR is a python based application where the user provides inputs values for the simulation (e.g: initial and monthly investment, annual profitability expected and the period in years) and the application shows how much money they will have in the period defined.

## Features

- [x]  Get simulation values from the user
- [x]  Output the simulation result on screen
- [x]  Store simulation result data on a .csv file
- [x]  Shows Monthly Profit graph
- [x]  Shows Monthly Interest Amount graph


## Project Explanation

#### 1. Store data simulation values

The user has to provide exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a csv file. To validate this logic, there is the following function:

```python
  def check_command_line_ags():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Too few command-line arguments")
        sys.exit(1)
    elif len(sys.argv) > 2:
        print("Too many command-line arguments")
        sys.exit(1)
    elif not sys.argv[1].endswith(".csv"):
        print(f"{sys.argv[1]} is not a CSV file")
        sys.exit(1)
```

To store data in .csv file, it was used a method 'to_csv' of pandas library:

```python
investment.to_csv(r'C:\Users\Elton\Documents\Python_Project\investment.csv')
```


#### 2. Validate inputs variables from user

The user has to provide positive numeric values for all 4 question:

```python
    # Initial Investiment
    question1 = input("What is your initial investiment in USD? \n")
    initial_investment = get_float_from_input(question1)

    # Monthly investment
    question2 = input("What will be your monthly investiment in USD? \n")
    monthly_investment = get_float_from_input(question2)

    # Profitability
    question3 = input("What annual profitability(%) will you consider above inflation? \n")
    year_prof = get_float_from_input(question3)
    month_prof = (year_prof / 12) / 100

    # Period in years
    question4 = input("How many years do you want to leave your money invested? \n")
    period_in_years = get_int_from_input(question4)
    period_in_months = period_in_years * 12
    if period_in_months == 0:
        sys.exit("No period defined for the simulation")
```

To handle errors of user's input, there is this 2 functions:

```python
    def get_float_from_input(question) -> float:
        try:
            answer = float(question)
            if answer < 0:
                raise ValueError
            else:
                return answer
        except ValueError:
            sys.exit("Wrong value used! Expected a positive numeric value.")
```

```python
    def get_int_from_input(question) -> int:
        try:
            answer = int(question)
            if answer < 0:
                raise ValueError
            else:
                return answer
        except ValueError:
            sys.exit("Wrong value used! Expected a positive numeric value.")
```

#### 3. Simulation process

Once the user provide all inputs correctly, the following function runs and create a dataframe object using pandas library to store data. 

```python
    def populate_df(months : int, init_inv : float, monthly_inv : float, m_prof : float) -> pd.DataFrame:
        # Amount = C*(1+i)^n
        # C = Capital invested
        # i = interest
        # n = period

        # Create data frame in pandas
        df = pd.DataFrame()
        # Create loop in period range
        for m in range(1, months + 1):

            if m == 1:
                # Opening balance for m == 1 : it is the initial investment
                opening_balance = init_inv
            else:
                # For m > 1, we get the final ammount of the last month as month opening balance
                try:
                    opening_balance = df.loc[m - 1, 'Final_Amount']
                except:
                    sys.exit("There is no profitability in this simulation")

            # Total investiment of the month will be opening_balance + monthly_investment
            month_inv_ammount = opening_balance + monthly_inv

            # Period interest ammount
            interest = month_inv_ammount * m_prof

            # Final month amount = Total investiment of the month + interest
            final_month_amount = month_inv_ammount + interest

            # Insert data in the investment dataframe
            df.loc[m, 'Opening_Balance'] = round(opening_balance, 2)
            df.loc[m, 'Monthly_Investment'] = round(monthly_inv, 2)
            df.loc[m, 'Total_Month_Investment_Amount'] = round(month_inv_ammount, 2)
            df.loc[m, 'Interest_Amount'] = round(interest, 2)
            df.loc[m, 'Final_Amount'] = round(final_month_amount, 2)
            df.index.name = 'Month'

        # Return dataframe
        return df
```

#### 4. Results

The user get the simulation summary printed on screen:

```python
    # Print results
    print(
        "====================================================================================================================================")
    print(f"In {period_in_years} year(s) you will have ${final_amount:,.2f}")
    print(f"Total invested : ${total_invested:,.2f}")
    print(
        f"Taking into account an annual interest of {(year_prof / 100):.2%}, you will earn ${total_interest_earned:,.2f} of interest amount.")
    print(f"It means that {(total_interest_earned / final_amount):.02%} of all you will have came from interests.")
    print(f"Finally, you earned {profitability:.02%} of all you invested! ")
    print(
        "====================================================================================================================================")
```

As well as 2 graphics using plotly library. A line graph representing 'Monthly Profit':
```python
    def line_graph(df, x, y, title):
        graphic = px.line(df, x, y, title=title)
        graphic.show()
```

And a scatter graph representing 'Monthly Interest Amount':
```python
    def scatter_graph(df, x, y, title):
        graphic = px.scatter(df, x, y, title=title, hover_data=[df.index])
        graphic.show()
```
